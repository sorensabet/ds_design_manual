    "Method 1: Create a distribution using verified historical data for each of the variables being measured, and compare data coming from the sensor. Use a statistical test to determine if the data coming from the new sensor is statistically different from the historical dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: For some variables, check if the data makes sense. For example, body temperature will fall within a specific range for any living person. If the sensor measures an incorrect temperature, it is not working. \n",

    "Method 3: If the sensor is being used on the same patient, compare it with another sensor that is the Gold Standard\n"
